Platforms: tested on Windows 64bit OS (should work on Linux)
Applications: Exact maximum clique-family of publihed algorithms BBMC: BBMC, BBMCR, BBMCL, BBMCX, BMCXR, BBMCSP, BBMCPara

This small library contains the two basic classes Graph and Ugraph which implement bit encoded graphs in 64 bit computers. They wrap basic functionality to build directed and undirected graphs, used successfully un a number of research projects related to combinatorial optimization. In particular the lib is at the core of BBMC a leading bit parallel algorithm for the maximum clique problem.

Date: Septembre 2014
A new feature is now provided with GRAPH which analyses any graph and provides useful information. At the moment: maximum and minimum graph degree, k-core decomposition and number, minimum width sorting are supported. Moreover k-core analysis also gives a useful upper bound for maximum clique (k-core number+1). A reasonablyl tight lower bound for maximum clique is also provided.

In [5], BBMC was rated fastest wrt to other state of the art exact maximum clique algorithms.
